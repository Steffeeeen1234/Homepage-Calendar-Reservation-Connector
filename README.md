# Homepage Calendar Reservation Connector
Vision: Make reservations at doctors and plumbers as easy as reserving a table at your famous restaurant

This project is all about digitialization.

In our common world you are able to bock a seat in a cinema or a table in a fancy restaurant from your smartphone BUT you are not able (in most of the cases in Germany) to bock a free spot at the doctor (e.g. dentist, or others) or at some technical company (e.g. plumber). 
In those cases you still have to call them. 
Most of the time you will not reach them because they will not be available.

In a world were we have chat bots, vaice bots and everything it is still so hard to bock easy a free space at the dcotor.

The vision of this project Make reservations at doctors and plumbers as easy as reserving a table at your famous restaurant
