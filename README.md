# Homepage Calendar Reservation Connector
# Vision
Make reservations at doctors and plumbers as easy as reserving a table at your famous restaurant

# Introduction
This project is all about digitialization.

In our common world you are able to bock a seat in a cinema or a table in a fancy restaurant from your smartphone BUT you are not able (in most of the cases in Germany) to bock a free spot at the doctor (e.g. dentist, or others) or at some technical company (e.g. plumber). 
In those cases you still have to call them. 
Most of the time you will not reach them because they will not be available, are already out of office, are on vacation, etc.

In a world were we have chat bots, voice bots and everything it is still so hard to bock a free space at the dcotors office.

Therefore the vision of this project is: Make reservations at doctors and plumbers as easy as reserving a table at your famous restaurant

# Goals
1. Help to connect these poor souls (doctors and plumbers) via their homepage to their new clients (e. g. Gen Y and Gen Z). 
1. This project should provide a calendar which can be integrated to your homepage easy. 
1. It should provide a possibility to maintain the time for reservation spots. So that it fits the doctors office.
1. It should provide a onnector to your favourite calendar (Outlook, Gmail, Notes, or what so ever).
1. If possible it should be possible for google home, alexa, instagram, facebook, siri, etc. to bock a free spot via voice.
1. Facebook bots and other bots should be able to use this standard or the connectors as well.
1. The source of all of this will be free to use. Even if the company makes money out of this usage. (Todo: find out which licenz I have to set up for this)
1. bring digitilization a step forward to a new area.
1. make it possiblit to have an easy way to share your company calendar on your company website
1. it needs to also fit in website building tools like wordpress

# Research

## Research Questions
Q: Is there no possibility to bock a doctors appoint online?<br>
A: Sure there are. There is for example this: <br>
- https://www.medorganizer.de/medorganizer/ but they are a company who live from providing such a service and many more features. 
I think the calendar feature is the most important one an can bring a lot benefit.
- https://www.jameda.de/ 
- this contains a set of other plattforms: https://t3n.de/news/arzttermine-online-buchen-1124001/
